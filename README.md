# Satellite image segmentation using Deep Learning Model
## Introduction:
  Deep learning has revolutionized the analysis and interpretation of satellite and aerial imagery, addressing unique challenges such as vast image sizes and a wide array of object classes. This repository provides an exhaustive overview of deep learning techniques specifically tailored for satellite and aerial image processing using the U-Net model.

## Model:

The U-Net model is employed in this project for semantic segmentation of satellite images. U-Net is known for its efficiency and accuracy in handling image segmentation tasks, making it a suitable choice for this application.

## Dataset
### Context
Humans in the Loop is publishing an open-access dataset annotated for a joint project with the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center in Dubai, UAE.

### Content
The dataset consists of aerial imagery of Dubai obtained by MBRSC satellites and annotated with pixel-wise semantic segmentation in 6 classes. The total volume of the dataset is 72 images grouped into 6 larger tiles. The classes are:
  - Building: #3C1098
  - Land (unpaved area): #8429F6
  - Road: #6EC1E4
  - Vegetation: #FEDD3A
  - Water: #E2A929
  - Unlabeled: #9B9B9B
